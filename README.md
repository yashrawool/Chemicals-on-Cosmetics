# Chemicals-on-Cosmetics

**Introduction:**  

Hello everyone, my name is Yash, and I’m excited to present an analysis of **Chemicals in Cosmetics**, drawing insights from data reported to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP). This program, under the California Department of Public Health, aims to ensure transparency about hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California.  

The **California Safe Cosmetics Act** mandates manufacturers, packers, and distributors to report cosmetic products containing ingredients identified as carcinogens or toxicants. These reports include key details such as product labels, brands, chemical compositions, and the number of hazardous chemicals per product.

As part of this project, we have developed two machine learning models:  
1. **Product Discontinuation Prediction Model:** This model predicts the likelihood of products being discontinued based on their chemical composition and other attributes.  
2. **Product Clustering Model:** Using clustering techniques, we’ve grouped products based on similarities in chemical composition and toxicity levels to identify trends and potential risk factors.  

Through exploratory data analysis and modeling, we aim to uncover significant patterns, highlight potential regulatory and safety concerns, and support better decision-making for both companies and consumers. Let’s dive into the findings!
